## Hash Table

Hash Table is a data structure which organizes data using hash functions in order to support quick insertion and search.

There are two different kinds of hash tables: hash set and hash map.

### Hash Set

The hash set is one of the implementations of a set data structure to store no repeated values.
Typically, a hash set is used to check if a value has ever appeared or not.

### Hash Map

The hash map is one of the implementations of a map data structure to store (key, value) pairs.

The first scenario to use a hash map is that we need more information rather than only the key. Then we can build a mapping relationship between key and information by hash map.
