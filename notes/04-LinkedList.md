# LinkedList

### Definition
The inked list is a linear data structure storing elements, in which each is actually a separate object 
while all the objects are **linked together by the reference field** in each element.

## Question
### 1 - Reverse a SlinkedList

### 2 - Reverse a DlinkedList

### 3 - Print the shared part of two ordered SlinkedLists

### 4 - Whether a linked list is Palindrome

### 5 - Sort a SlinkedList
Given the `head` node of a SlinkedList, with node value - Integer, and an integer `pivot`. Sort the list so that 
the left part of the list is less than `pivot`, the middle part of the list is equal to the `pivot`, and the right part
of the list is greater than the `pivot`.

### 6 - SlinkedList Intersection
