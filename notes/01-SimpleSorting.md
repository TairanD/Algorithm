# Simple Sorting
In this file, 3 types of sorting algorithms (used to sort the order of a group of elements) will be introduced: 
selection sort, bubble sort, and insertion sort.

## 0 - Method Swap()
The method takes three parameters: 
1. the data structure containing elements.
2. the index of one of the elements waiting to swap.
3. the index of the other one.

## 1 - Selection Sorting
Maybe the most easy one, just directly iterate all elements N times. For each iteration, find the smallest elements.

The time performance of selection sort is strictly **O(N^2)**.

## 2 - Bubble Sorting
